# Metrics to add

## Fundamentals

- No undefined entities referenced (or throw runtime exception?)
- No teleport: each entity can move only to adjacent nodes
- Successful test:
  - No Agent collides with obstacle
  - Each Agent Reaches its objective

## Main metrics for tests

- MakeSpan (per agent)
- Maximum Makespan
- Average Makespan
- Sum of Costs (all agents)

## Other useful metrics for tests


## Main aggregated metrics for benchmark

- Average success rate 
- Average Makespan
